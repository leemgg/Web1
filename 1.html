<h2><strong>Simulating Intelligence</strong></h2>
Techniques for prototyping machine learning systems across products and features<br><br>

By Mike Dory and Mindy DelliCarpini<p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">In the early days of any product cycle—for everything from a small tweak in an established app to a shiny, new product—uncertainty often runs rampant. Doubts about product reach, impact, and engineering effort get amplified when working with new technologies like machine learning (ML). However, there’s good news: exploratory prototyping can help. By building quick, real-feeling (and often wholly simulated) versions of products and features, teams can be nimble, explore various directions, fail early, and pivot repeatedly—all before going too far through the entire costly, messy ML development process.</p>

What to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank">prototype</a>, and when?</p>
When we talk about prototyping here, we mean creating a rapidly-built, probably not-meant-for-production-use approximation of a future product or feature. We do this to accelerate our ability to validate product market fit, explore feasibility, and learn from the product’s users. For example, if a planned feature would normally take six months to research, design, build, and test, that’s five-and-a-half months too late to find out that the idea is flawed in the first place. Perhaps it didn’t consider bias or address inclusivity concerns, or simply just doesn’t feel useful to the target audience. A good prototype gives you a shortcut to rapidly test your assumptions with your users, and to course-correct incrementally as you go.
